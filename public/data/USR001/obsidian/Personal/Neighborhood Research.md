# Neighborhood Research

Notes from our house hunting research. These are areas we've been seriously considering for relocation. Each has its own character and trade-offs.

## Austin, Texas

We spent a long weekend in Austin last month and honestly, I can see why everyone's moving there. The energy is just different - younger crowd, tons of live music, and the food scene is incredible. But let me break down what we actually learned about living there.

**East Austin / Mueller Area**

This is where all the young professionals seem to be settling. The Mueller development is interesting - it's a planned community built on the old airport land, so you get this mix of new construction townhomes and single family homes, all very walkable with parks and trails. The vibe is very "Austin weird" - lots of food trucks, craft breweries, and murals everywhere. We walked around and saw families with strollers alongside folks heading to yoga studios and coffee shops.

The schools situation here is a bit mixed though. Austin ISD serves this area and while there are some good elementary schools, we heard from a few parents that middle school options get tricky. Some families end up going private or doing charter schools. Something to dig into more if we're serious. The commute to downtown is easy - maybe 15 minutes without traffic - but I-35 is apparently a nightmare during rush hour.

Housing prices have come down a bit from the crazy 2022 peak. We saw nice 3-bedroom bungalows in the $800k-900k range, which feels more reasonable than what we'd pay in California. The older homes have character but you'll want to budget for updates - a lot of them have that 1950s vibe that's charming but needs work.

**Tarrytown**

If we want the "established family neighborhood" feel, Tarrytown is the spot. Tree-lined streets, bigger lots, and it's right near Lake Austin so you can kayak or paddleboard on weekends. The schools here are genuinely excellent - Casis Elementary and O. Henry Middle School both have strong reputations and we met parents who were really happy with them.

The downside? Price. We're looking at $1.5M+ for a decent family home, and many of the houses are from the 60s so there's deferred maintenance to think about. Also, while it's close to downtown, there's not much walkable - you'll drive to restaurants and shops. It feels more suburban despite being central. Good for raising kids, maybe less exciting for us as a couple in our 30s who still want some nightlife occasionally.

**South Congress (SoCo)**

This is the "cool Austin" everyone talks about. Amazing restaurants, boutique shopping, and the whole area just feels alive. We grabbed tacos at a food trailer and browsed vintage shops - it was a great afternoon. But actually living here? The housing stock is limited - mostly older bungalows that go for a premium because of location, or newer condo developments.

Not really a family neighborhood. The elementary schools are okay but nothing special, and it's more of a destination than a residential community. I could see us here in a condo if we were younger and didn't care about space, but with a kid potentially in the picture in a few years, probably not the move.

## Denver, Colorado

Denver has been on our radar because we both love hiking and skiing, and the idea of having the mountains an hour away is really appealing. We visited in fall and the weather was perfect - sunny, crisp, beautiful. Here's what we found about the different neighborhoods.

**Cherry Creek**

This is Denver's upscale shopping and dining district, and the residential streets around it are genuinely lovely. Mature trees, well-maintained homes, and everything feels very polished. We walked through Cherry Creek North and had an amazing brunch at a place overlooking the creek trail.

The housing here is expensive by Denver standards - you're looking at $1.5M+ for a nice single family home - but compared to what we'd pay in the Bay Area, it still feels like a deal. The homes tend to be mid-century ranches that have been renovated, with some newer construction mixed in. Schools in this area are strong - the Cherry Creek School District is one of the best in the state, though we'd need to verify exact boundaries.

My concern with Cherry Creek is that it feels a bit... sterile? Very safe and pleasant, but maybe lacking personality. The people we met were nice but it had more of a suburban vibe despite being pretty central. Good for families, maybe less exciting for us personally.

**Washington Park (Wash Park)**

This might be my favorite Denver neighborhood. Classic bungalows from the 1920s-40s, the gorgeous park itself with the lake and running paths, and a real community feel. On Sunday morning the park was full of people jogging, playing with dogs, having picnics. There are good local restaurants and coffee shops on the edges of the neighborhood.

Housing here is competitive - the classic bungalows are in high demand and usually need updating. We saw a few in the $1.1M-1.3M range that needed new kitchens and bathrooms. The lots are decent sized though, and you could add on or finish a basement. Schools are Denver Public Schools, which is more mixed - some elementaries are great, others less so. You'd want to research the specific school for whatever house you're looking at.

The walkability is great for Denver. You can walk to the park, to coffee, to a few restaurants. Not quite urban walkability, but better than most Denver neighborhoods.

**Highlands Ranch**

We drove out to Highlands Ranch because friends of ours live there and love it. It's about 20 minutes south of downtown in the suburbs, and it's a totally different experience from the city neighborhoods. Very planned community feel - everything is new, manicured, and designed for families.

The schools are legitimately excellent. Douglas County School District is consistently top-rated in Colorado, and parents we talked to were really happy. The homes are newer construction, much bigger than what you'd get closer in - we saw 5-bedroom houses with finished basements and mountain views for under $900k. If space and schools are the priority, this is hard to beat.

But - and this is a big but - it doesn't feel like Denver. It feels like any nice suburb anywhere. The commute to downtown is 30-45 minutes depending on traffic. There's not much character or walkability. You'd be driving to everything. For us, the whole point of moving to Denver is the lifestyle, and I'm not sure Highlands Ranch delivers that. Great for families who prioritize schools and space over urban amenities though.

## Seattle, Washington

Seattle has always appealed to me - the water, the mountains, the coffee culture. We spent almost a week there and really tried to understand the different neighborhoods. The gray weather is real (it drizzled basically the whole time we were there) but people seem to love it anyway.

**Queen Anne**

Lower Queen Anne is right by the Space Needle and Seattle Center, very urban and walkable. Upper Queen Anne is the residential part up the hill with those classic craftsman homes and absolutely stunning views of the skyline, Puget Sound, and the mountains on clear days. We stood at Kerry Park and just stared - it's that beautiful.

The housing on Upper Queen Anne is pricey - $1.4M+ for a craftsman that probably needs some work. These are older homes, 1920s mostly, with the charm and the maintenance requirements that come with that. The streets are steep, which is fun and also means you'll get a workout walking anywhere. Schools are Seattle Public Schools - mixed reviews, some families go private.

What I really liked about Queen Anne is that it feels like a real neighborhood. We walked to a little bakery, saw families at the park, chatted with people walking their dogs. It's not trendy or hip, it's just... nice. Established. Maybe a bit quiet for some people, but I found it appealing.

**Ballard**

Ballard is where the action is right now in Seattle. It used to be a Scandinavian fishing village (there's still a great Nordic heritage museum) and has transformed into this buzzy neighborhood full of breweries, restaurants, and boutiques. The food scene is excellent - we had an amazing dinner at a farm-to-table place and hit up three different breweries.

New construction is happening everywhere in Ballard, so you can find modern townhomes and single family homes with all the updates. Prices are similar to Queen Anne - maybe slightly less, around $1.8M for new construction with good finishes. The older homes are more like $1.3M-1.5M but will need work.

The vibe here is definitely younger and hipper than Queen Anne. Lots of 30-somethings, strollers mixed with people heading to taprooms. The walkability is great along the main strips. Schools are fine but not the reason people move here. The downside is that Ballard can feel crowded on weekends and parking is a nightmare. Also, the tech boom has changed the character a lot - some longtime residents complain it's lost its soul. I didn't feel that way as a visitor, but I can imagine how change is hard.

**Bellevue (Eastside)**

We took the bridge over to Bellevue to check out the Eastside, since so many tech companies have offices there now. It's a different world from Seattle proper - more suburban, more polished, more corporate feeling. Downtown Bellevue has some nice high-rises and a big mall, but the residential areas feel very... planned.

The big draw is schools. Bellevue School District is excellent, consistently ranked among the best in Washington. Housing is expensive though - we're talking $3M+ for a nice single family home with Lake Washington access, or maybe $1M for a condo. The tech money has really pushed prices up.

Honestly, Bellevue didn't grab us. It felt like it could be any nice tech suburb anywhere. If schools and safety are the absolute priority and you don't care about urban character, it makes sense. But for us, the whole appeal of the Pacific Northwest is the natural beauty and the culture, and Bellevue feels like it traded that for convenience. I'd rather commute from a real neighborhood in Seattle.

## Atlanta, Georgia

Atlanta surprised us. I had this image of it being very sprawling and car-dependent, and parts of it definitely are, but the intown neighborhoods have real character and walkability. The cost of living is dramatically lower than the west coast, which is appealing. Here's what we found.

**Virginia Highland**

This was my favorite Atlanta neighborhood. Tree-lined streets with 1920s-40s bungalows, a walkable village center with restaurants and shops, and a genuinely neighborly vibe. We grabbed coffee and walked around for a couple hours - saw people sitting on porches chatting, kids riding bikes, the whole thing. It felt like a small town that happens to be in a city.

Housing is relatively affordable - nice bungalows in the $800k-900k range, though they're older and will need updates. The lots are decent sized and most have private backyards. Schools are Atlanta Public Schools, which has a mixed reputation, but we heard good things about the elementary school in Virginia Highland specifically. Some families do private school starting in middle school.

The downside is that it's not super close to any major employment centers, so you'd be commuting. The BeltLine (a converted rail trail) runs near here, which is great for biking and walking. Overall, Virginia Highland feels like the kind of place where you'd actually get to know your neighbors, which appeals to me.

**Midtown**

Midtown is Atlanta's arts and culture center - Piedmont Park, the High Museum, lots of restaurants and nightlife. It's the closest thing Atlanta has to an urban neighborhood. You can walk or bike to a lot, especially along the BeltLine, and there's real street life here.

Housing is mostly condos and high-rises in Midtown proper. We saw 2-bedroom condos in newer buildings for around $650k-700k, which is pretty reasonable for what you get. The amenities in these buildings are nice - pools, gyms, rooftop decks. For a single person or a couple without kids, Midtown would be great. Super walkable, lots to do, easy access to everything.

But for families, it's trickier. Not many single family homes, and the schools situation is unclear for condo residents. You'd probably need to research specific building addresses. Also, urban living in Atlanta means dealing with some of the usual city issues - homeless population, occasional crime. Nothing that felt unsafe when we visited, but worth noting.

**Buckhead**

Buckhead is Atlanta's wealthy enclave - big mansions, luxury shopping, country club vibes. We drove through and the homes are genuinely impressive, set back on large wooded lots with gates and long driveways. If you have the money, it's clearly a beautiful place to live.

But it didn't feel like us. Very formal, very car-dependent despite the wealth. The restaurant scene is more upscale steakhouses than interesting indie spots. Schools are good - private school culture is strong here. Prices are steep, $3M+ for the nice estates, though you can find more modest homes in some Buckhead subdivisions for $1-2M.

I think Buckhead makes sense for a certain type of buyer - established professionals, families who prioritize prestige and schools and don't mind the suburban-within-the-city feel. For us, it felt a bit stuffy. Virginia Highland or even Inman Park (which we drove through briefly and liked) seem more our speed.
