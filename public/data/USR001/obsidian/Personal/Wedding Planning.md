# Wedding Planning

We're engaged! After the initial excitement, the reality set in that we actually have to plan this thing. This is my master document for keeping track of everything - decisions made, ideas to explore, and the million details that apparently go into a wedding.

## The Vision

Before diving into vendors and budgets, we need to agree on what we actually want:

**Our style:** Romantic but not over-the-top. Elegant without being stuffy. We want people to have fun, not sit through a ceremony that feels like a performance.

**Vibe words:** Garden party, soft colors, candlelight, good food, great music, love everywhere

**What we DON'T want:**
- Cookie-cutter hotel ballroom wedding
- Cheesy DJ games
- Anything that feels like an assembly line
- Forced traditions we don't care about

**Size:** Aiming for 100-120 guests. Big enough to include everyone important, small enough to actually talk to people.

## The Dress & Attire

### Bridal Gown

This is her domain, but from our discussions, she's looking for:
- Something romantic but not too princessy
- Probably A-line or fit-and-flare silhouette
- Delicate lace or subtle embellishments
- Cathedral or chapel length train
- Comfortable enough to dance in

She's been saving photos of ethereal, flowy gowns with delicate details. Nothing too structured or heavy.

**Budget:** $2,000-4,000 for the dress itself

**Shopping plan:**
- Appointment at bridal boutiques
- Try different silhouettes before committing to a style
- Order 6-8 months before wedding for alterations time

### Bridal Accessories

**Veil:**
- Soft tulle, cathedral length to match train
- Maybe some delicate lace edging
- Not too heavy or structured

**Jewelry for the bride:**
- Something delicate to complement the dress, not compete with it
- Pearl drop earrings would be beautiful - elegant, bridal, timeless
- Delicate diamond or pearl pendant necklace
- Simple tennis bracelet or pearl bracelet
- Family jewelry is an option too - something borrowed

**Hair accessories:**
- Crystal or pearl hair pins
- Maybe a simple tiara or headband
- Fresh flowers could be beautiful with the right dress

**Shoes:**
- Something comfortable (she'll be standing all day)
- Block heel or wedge, not stilettos
- Probably ivory or champagne to match dress

### Groom's Attire

For me, keeping it classic:
- Navy or charcoal suit, possibly a tuxedo depending on formality
- Slim fit, modern but not trendy
- Quality fabric that photographs well

**Accessories:**
- Nice watch - this could be a good time to upgrade to something I'll wear forever
- Tie or bow tie depending on the vibe
- Cufflinks - something meaningful, maybe a gift from her
- Pocket square
- Good dress shoes - black or oxblood leather

**Groomsmen:**
- Matching suits or coordinated colors
- Matching ties or bow ties

## Flowers - Setting the Mood

Flowers are apparently a huge part of the budget but they really do set the entire aesthetic.

### Color Palette

Leaning toward soft, romantic colors:
- Blush pink
- Cream and ivory
- Soft peach
- Touches of greenery
- Maybe some dusty blue or mauve as accents

### Bridal Bouquet

The centerpiece (literally) of the flower situation.

Looking at:
- Garden roses - lush, romantic, photograph beautifully
- Peonies if in season - her favorite flower
- Ranunculus - delicate layers, very romantic
- White or blush roses as a base
- Lots of greenery - eucalyptus, olive branches
- Cascading style or loose, organic shape - not a tight round ball

### Bridesmaid Bouquets

Smaller versions of the bridal bouquet, coordinated but not identical. Maybe slightly different flower ratios to add visual interest.

### Ceremony Flowers

- Arch or chuppah decorated with climbing roses and greenery - statement piece for photos
- Aisle markers - small arrangements or petals
- Maybe potted plants we can take home after

### Reception Centerpieces

Ideas:
- Low arrangements so people can see across the table - garden roses and candles
- Mix of tall and low for visual interest
- Lots of candles interspersed
- Greenery runners down long tables
- Maybe some fruit or branches for organic feel

### Other Floral Needs

- Boutonnieres for groom and groomsmen
- Corsages for mothers and grandmothers
- Flower girl basket
- Cake flowers (fresh flowers on cake)
- Petals for flower girl

### Flower Budget

This adds up fast:
| Item | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| Bridal bouquet | $200-350 |
| Bridesmaid bouquets (5) | $400-600 |
| Boutonnieres (6) | $100-150 |
| Corsages (4) | $80-120 |
| Ceremony arch/flowers | $500-1,000 |
| Centerpieces (12 tables) | $800-1,500 |
| Other details | $200-300 |
| **Total** | **$2,300-4,000** |

## The Rings

### Engagement Ring

Already done! But for posterity:
- Oval cut diamond - she wanted something elegant and elongating
- Delicate band, not too thick
- Platinum or white gold setting
- She loves it and that's what matters

### Wedding Bands

**For her:**
- Something that fits with the engagement ring
- Probably a thin diamond band or plain platinum
- Maybe a matching set that stacks nicely
- Or something with small diamonds all around - eternity style

**For me:**
- Classic and simple - I don't wear jewelry usually
- Platinum or white gold to match hers
- Maybe a brushed finish for some texture
- Comfortable - I'll be wearing this forever
- Not too wide, maybe 4-5mm

## Hair & Beauty

### Bridal Beauty

**Hair:**
- She's thinking soft waves, maybe half up half down
- Or a low romantic bun with loose pieces around face
- Trial run with hairstylist before the day

**Makeup:**
- Natural but enhanced - she wants to look like herself
- Soft smoky eye, not dramatic
- Good lasting power for photos and tears
- Trial run essential

**Skincare:**
- Starting a good routine now for wedding-day glow
- Looking at facials and treatments leading up
- See [[Shopping List]] for skincare items

### Fragrance

She wants a special perfume just for the wedding - something she'll always associate with that day.

Looking at:
- Something romantic and feminine
- Floral but sophisticated, not too sweet
- Notes like rose, jasmine, or peony would be fitting
- Chanel Coco Mademoiselle has that romantic elegance
- Dior J'adore is classic and glamorous
- Something from Viktor & Rolf like Flowerbomb is romantic
- Miss Dior is pretty and soft
- Could also get something custom or niche

For the groom, probably my regular cologne but freshly applied.

## The Cake

### Style Ideas

Not a huge fondant tower - something more organic and modern:
- Naked or semi-naked cake showing the layers
- Fresh flowers as decoration
- Maybe a drip design with chocolate or caramel
- Multiple small cakes or a dessert table could be fun too
- Buttercream over fondant - tastes better

### Flavors to Try

- Classic vanilla with raspberry filling
- Chocolate with salted caramel
- Lemon with elderflower
- Champagne cake with strawberries

### Alternatives/Additions

- Cupcake tower in addition to small cutting cake
- Pie bar (he loves pie)
- Donut wall for late night snacking
- French macarons in our wedding colors - beautiful as favors too
- Mini cheesecakes
- Cookies for late-night snack

**Budget for cake:** $500-800 for tiered cake

## Reception Food & Drink

### Cocktail Hour

The gap between ceremony and reception - keep people fed and happy:
- Passed appetizers - bruschetta, mini crab cakes, stuffed mushrooms
- Cheese and charcuterie display
- Fresh fruit and vegetables
- Signature cocktails

### Dinner Service

Deciding between:
- **Plated dinner** - more formal, easier to control timing
- **Family style** - communal, more relaxed vibe
- **Buffet** - variety, people serve themselves

Leaning toward family style - fits our aesthetic and encourages conversation.

### Menu Ideas

Starter: butternut squash soup or mixed green salad

Mains (choice):
- Herb-roasted chicken with seasonal vegetables
- Beef tenderloin or grilled salmon
- Vegetarian option - stuffed portobello or pasta primavera

Sides: roasted potatoes, sauteed green beans, fresh bread

### Bar Setup

- Open bar during cocktail hour and dinner (wine and beer at minimum)
- Signature his and hers cocktails
- Good champagne for toast
- Non-alcoholic options - mocktails, sparkling water, nice lemonade

### Late Night Snacks

Keep the party going:
- Slider station
- Pizza delivery at 11pm
- Gourmet grilled cheese
- Dessert bar with coffee
