# First Apartment Checklist

Moving into my first real apartment - not a dorm, not my parents' house, an actual apartment that's mine. This is equal parts exciting and terrifying. I have basically nothing, so I need to build a home from scratch without going broke.

## The Philosophy

I've seen too many people either:
1. Buy everything cheap and replace it in two years
2. Go into debt buying the "forever" version of everything immediately

My approach: **invest in things you touch every day** (mattress, sofa, desk chair), go budget on things that just need to exist (hangers, trash cans, basic dishes). I can upgrade later when I have more money and know what I actually need.

## The Absolute Essentials (Week One)

These are the things I literally cannot function without. Moving in on Saturday, need these ready.

### Sleep Setup
- **Mattress** - This is worth spending money on. Looking at a queen size memory foam or hybrid mattress, medium firm. The mattresses that come compressed in a box seem like good value. Need the mattress foundation or bed frame to go with it.
- **Bedding** - At minimum: fitted sheet, flat sheet, two pillows, pillowcases, comforter or duvet with cover. Starting with a basic white or gray cotton sheet set.
- **Bed frame** - Something simple. A basic platform bed frame that doesn't need a box spring would be ideal. Could do a metal frame to start and upgrade later.

### Bathroom Basics
- **Towels** - Two bath towels, two hand towels, two washcloths to start
- **Shower curtain and rings** - Something simple, not the clear plastic kind
- **Bath mat** - So I don't slip and die
- **Toilet paper** - Don't forget the obvious
- **Trash can** - Small one for bathroom

### Kitchen Survival Kit
Literally just enough to feed myself:
- **Pots and pans** - One medium pot with lid, one large skillet. Nonstick to start.
- **Basic utensils** - Spatula, wooden spoon, tongs, can opener
- **Chef's knife** - Just one good one, plus a cutting board
- **Plates and bowls** - Four of each to start
- **Glasses and mugs** - Four of each
- **Flatware set** - Basic silverware set for four
- **Dish soap and sponge**
- **Paper towels**
- **Trash can and bags**

### Cleaning Basics
- **Broom and dustpan**
- **Mop or Swiffer**
- **All-purpose cleaner**
- **Toilet bowl cleaner and brush**

## Living Room - Building Comfort

This can wait a week or two, but I don't want to sit on the floor forever.

### Seating
**The sofa decision** is huge - I'll be sitting on this thing for years.

What I'm looking for:
- A comfortable three-seater sofa in a neutral color - gray or navy would hide stains and go with everything
- Fabric that's durable - something like a performance fabric or microfiber that can handle spills
- Not too deep, not too shallow - I want to actually sit on it, not sink into it
- Scandinavian or mid-century modern style would fit my taste - clean lines, tapered legs

Could also do a sectional if the space allows, but need to measure first.

**Additional seating:**
- An accent chair for when people come over - maybe something in a complementary color or a fun pattern
- Floor cushions or poufs are cheap ways to add seating

### Coffee Table
Need something to put drinks on and prop my feet on. Looking at:
- Rectangular coffee table with some storage - a shelf underneath for books/remotes
- Wood or wood-look top, maybe with metal legs for that mid-century vibe
- Something around 48 inches long to fit the space

### Entertainment Setup
- **TV stand or media console** - Something with storage for gaming consoles, books, etc. I like the minimalist Scandinavian look with cabinet doors to hide the mess.
- **TV** - Probably a 55-inch smart TV. 4K is standard now. Don't need OLED for the living room, a good LED will be fine.
- **Sound** - The TV speakers are always bad. At minimum a soundbar. Nothing crazy, just better than built-in.

### Lighting
Apartment lighting is usually terrible fluorescent or one overhead fixture.
- **Floor lamp** - Something with adjustable brightness for the living room corner
- **Table lamp** - For ambient lighting on an end table
- **Maybe string lights or LED strips** - For some personality

### Rugs
- Area rug for the living room to define the space and add warmth
- Something durable that can handle foot traffic - medium pile, neutral colors or subtle pattern

## Bedroom - The Retreat

Beyond the basics above, making it feel like a real bedroom:

### Furniture
- **Nightstand** - At least one, for phone/water/lamp. Something with a drawer is nice.
- **Dresser** - For clothes storage. Looking at a 6-drawer dresser in a wood tone that matches or complements the bed frame.
- **Maybe a small desk** - If I'm working from home sometimes. Or this could go in a separate office nook.

### Closet Organization
My closet will be a disaster without help:
- **Hangers** - Good ones, not wire. Velvet or wood hangers that won't destroy clothes.
- **Shoe rack** - Something that fits on the closet floor
- **Storage bins** - For seasonal stuff, extra bedding

### Comfort
- **Blackout curtains** - Essential for sleeping in
- **Extra blanket** - For cold nights
- **Full-length mirror** - Need to see what I look like before leaving

## Kitchen - Actually Cooking

Upgrading from survival mode to actually enjoying cooking:

### Cookware
- **Dutch oven** - For soups, stews, bread. Cast iron or enameled.
- **Sheet pans** - Two rimmed baking sheets for roasting vegetables, baking cookies
- **Mixing bowls** - Set of nesting bowls
- **Measuring cups and spoons**
- **Colander** - For draining pasta

### Small Appliances
- **Coffee maker** - Non-negotiable. A simple drip coffee maker or French press to start. Maybe a pour-over setup.
- **Toaster or toaster oven** - Toaster oven is more versatile
- **Blender** - For smoothies, sauces
- **Instant Pot or slow cooker** - Game changer for easy meals

### Food Storage
- **Glass containers** - For meal prep and leftovers. Glass is better than plastic.
- **Zip bags** - Various sizes
- **Aluminum foil and plastic wrap**

### Pantry Staples
See [[Grocery List]] for details, but the essentials:
- Olive oil, vegetable oil
- Salt, pepper, basic spices
- Rice, pasta, flour
- Canned beans, tomatoes
- Soy sauce, hot sauce
- Coffee, tea

## Home Office Corner

Working from home sometimes, so need a decent setup:

### Desk
- **Standing desk** would be ideal - electric sit-stand with memory presets
- If too expensive, a simple desk around 48-60 inches wide with good surface area
- Looking at wood top with metal frame, Scandinavian style

### Chair
This matters a lot for my back:
- **Ergonomic office chair** with lumbar support, adjustable armrests
- Mesh back for breathability
- Not a "gaming chair" - those look tacky and aren't actually that ergonomic

### Tech
- **Monitor** - A 27-inch display at minimum. 4K or 1440p resolution.
- **Lamp** - Desk lamp with adjustable arm for task lighting
- **Power strip with surge protection**
- **USB hub**

See [[Home Office Setup]] for more detailed planning.

## Bathroom - Beyond Basics

Making it feel like a real bathroom, not a dorm:

- **Shelving or cabinet** - Need somewhere to put toiletries
- **Mirror** (if not included) - Medicine cabinet or wall mirror
- **Toothbrush holder, soap dispenser** - Matching set looks nicer
- **Towel rack or hooks**
- **Wastebasket** - Something nicer than plastic

## Laundry Situation

If I have in-unit laundry (please):
- **Laundry detergent**
- **Dryer sheets or wool dryer balls**
- **Stain remover**
- **Iron and ironing board** (or steamer)
- **Laundry hamper** - Something that looks nice since it'll be visible

If shared laundry:
- **Laundry bag or basket** - For hauling to laundry room
- **Quarters** - Lots of quarters

## The Nice-to-Haves

Things I want eventually but don't need day one:

- **Plants** - Pothos, snake plant, something hard to kill
- **Art and decor** - Actual things on the walls
- **Bookshelf** - For books and display
- **Entry organization** - Key hooks, shoe storage, maybe a small bench
- **Bar cart** - For entertaining (aspirational)
- **Quality speakers** - Bluetooth speaker for music
- **Air purifier** - Especially if allergies are an issue
- **Robot vacuum** - Would be amazing but expensive

## Budget Planning

Rough estimates - need to track actual spending:

| Category | Budget | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Mattress + Bedding | $600-800 | High |
| Sofa | $500-800 | High |
| Bed Frame | $200-400 | High |
| TV + Stand | $400-600 | Medium |
| Desk + Chair | $400-600 | Medium |
| Kitchen Essentials | $200-300 | High |
| Bathroom Stuff | $100-150 | High |
| Bedroom Furniture | $300-400 | Medium |
| Living Room Extras | $200-300 | Low |
| Decor/Plants | $100-200 | Low |
| **Total** | **$3,000-4,550** | |

## Move-In Day Survival Kit

Have these IN THE CAR, not in the moving truck:
- Toilet paper
- Paper towels
- Hand soap
- Snacks and water
- Phone charger
- Basic tools (screwdriver, hammer, tape measure)
- Box cutter
- Trash bags
- First night toiletries

## Apartment Hunting Notes

- In-unit washer/dryer (or at least in-building)
- Good natural light
- Enough closet space
