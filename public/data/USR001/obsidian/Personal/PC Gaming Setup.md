# PC Gaming Setup

Finally taking the plunge and building a proper gaming PC. I've been gaming on a laptop for years and I'm tired of thermal throttling and compromises. This is my research and planning for the build.

## The Vision

I want a system that can handle modern AAA games at high settings on a 1440p monitor, with room for VR down the line. I also do some video editing and want to start streaming, so I need decent multi-threaded performance too. Budget is flexible but I'm thinking around $2,500-3,000 for the tower, then another $1,000-1,500 for monitor and peripherals.

The aesthetic I'm going for is clean and minimal - not the RGB rainbow vomit look. White or black case, maybe some subtle lighting, but mostly just a clean build with good cable management.

## CPU Decision

This is where I've been going back and forth the most. The two camps:

**AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D** - Everyone says this is THE gaming CPU right now. The 3D V-Cache apparently makes a huge difference in games, and the benchmarks back it up. 8 cores, 16 threads, which should be fine for streaming with NVENC on the GPU. The downside is it's "only" 8 cores, so for heavy video editing it might not be ideal. Also runs on AM5 which means DDR5 RAM (more expensive).

**Intel Core i7-14700K** - More cores (20 cores, 28 threads) which would be better for my video editing workflow. Gaming performance is close to the AMD in many titles, sometimes better in specific games. Uses LGA1700 socket which is mature. Downside is it runs hot and draws more power, so I'd need a beefy cooler.

Honestly leaning toward the AMD Ryzen 7800X3D because gaming is my primary use case. For the video editing I do (YouTube videos, nothing professional), 8 cores should be fine.

**Budget option**: If I need to cut costs, the Ryzen 5 7600X is solid for gaming at a much lower price point. Or even the Ryzen 5 5600X on the older AM4 platform if I want to save even more.

## GPU - The Heart of It

This is where most of the budget goes. Options I'm considering:

**NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super** - This is probably the sweet spot. 16GB VRAM (future-proofed for higher res textures), great 1440p performance, and DLSS 3 with frame generation for supported games. The "Super" refresh models seem to be the better value compared to the non-Super variants.

**NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Super** - Slightly cheaper, still 12GB VRAM, excellent 1440p performance. If I'm being honest, this might be all I need. The regular 4070 is also an option but seems like the Super is worth the small premium.

**AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT** - The value pick. 16GB VRAM, competitive performance, and usually cheaper than equivalent NVIDIA cards. I'd lose NVENC for streaming (AMD's encoder is decent but not as good) and DLSS (FSR is fine but not as refined). But if I'm trying to save money, this is compelling.

**Dream card**: RTX 4080 Super or even 4090, but that's probably overkill for 1440p gaming and blows the budget.

I think I'm going with the RTX 4070 Ti Super. Best balance of performance, features (DLSS, NVENC), and price.

## The Rest of the Build

**Motherboard** - Need something with AM5 socket for the Ryzen. Looking at B650 boards as a good balance of features and price. Don't need the X670 unless I'm doing serious overclocking, which I'm not.

**RAM** - DDR5-6000 seems to be the sweet spot for Ryzen 7000 series. 32GB (2x16GB) should be plenty. The CL30 kits seem like good value.

**Storage** - Definitely going NVMe SSD. A 2TB Gen4 drive for games and OS should be perfect. Maybe add a second drive later for video project files.

**Power Supply** - With a 4070 Ti Super and 7800X3D, I'm probably looking at around 600W actual draw. So an 850W PSU should give plenty of headroom. Fully modular for clean cable management.

**Case** - This is where aesthetics matter. I'm torn between:
- **Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO** - The classic. Great airflow, beautiful tempered glass, tons of room for building
- **NZXT H7 Flow** - Clean, minimal, good airflow. Comes in white which I like
- **Corsair 4000D Airflow** - Budget-friendly but still looks great and has excellent thermals
- **Fractal Design Torrent** - Apparently incredible airflow, but bigger than I'd like

Leaning toward the Lian Li or NZXT. The white NZXT H7 Flow is probably the winner for my aesthetic.

**Cooling** - For the 7800X3D, a good air cooler or 240mm AIO should be plenty. It doesn't run that hot. Going with an air cooler probably - less points of failure and the Noctua or be quiet! towers perform great.

## Monitor Situation

Currently using a 1080p 60Hz display, which is basically criminal for a gaming setup. Time to upgrade.

**Target specs:**
- 1440p resolution (4K is overkill and harder to drive)
- 144Hz minimum, 165Hz+ preferred
- IPS or OLED panel (not a fan of VA black smearing)
- 27-32 inches

**Options I'm looking at:**

**LG 27" OLED Gaming Monitor** - OLED would be incredible for the contrast and response times. The 27-inch 1440p OLED panels are finally hitting reasonable prices. Perfect blacks, amazing for single-player cinematic games.

**Samsung 32" Odyssey G7** - Great VA alternative if OLED is too expensive. 1440p 240Hz curved panel. The curve isn't for everyone but some people love it.

**Standard 27" 1440p 165Hz IPS** - Tons of options in this category at good prices. Not as flashy as OLED but proven technology, no burn-in concerns.

If I can swing it, the LG OLED is the dream. Otherwise a solid 27" IPS gaming monitor will be great.

## Desk & Chair Situation

My current setup is a disaster - cheap IKEA desk that wobbles and an office chair that's destroying my back. Time to upgrade.

**Desk:**

Really want a standing desk since I'm at my computer so much. The electric sit-stand desks with memory presets seem worth it - being able to switch positions throughout the day would be great for my back.

Looking for something at least 60 inches wide to fit a dual monitor setup eventually, with good cable management. Solid surface, not glass.

**Chair:**

This might be more important than any component honestly. Spent way too many hours in a bad chair. Options:

- **Ergonomic mesh office chair** - Something with proper lumbar support, adjustable arms, headrest. Not necessarily "gaming" branded, just actually comfortable.
- The "gaming chairs" with racing aesthetics look kind of tacky to me and I've heard mixed reviews on actual comfort.

Budget around $300-400 for a chair that will last years. Worth the investment.

## Peripherals

**Keyboard** - Mechanical, obviously. Thinking a compact layout (75% or TKL) to save desk space. Cherry MX Brown or similar tactile switches. Not sure if I want wireless or not - lower latency with wired but cleaner desk with wireless.

**Mouse** - Need something lightweight with a good sensor. The Logitech G Pro X Superlight or similar seems to be the gold standard. Wireless gaming mice have gotten so good that there's basically no latency penalty anymore.

**Headset** - For gaming and Discord. Wireless would be nice. Good mic quality for streaming. The Sony and SteelSeries options seem well-reviewed.

**Mousepad** - Large desk mat to cover the whole desk area. Cleaner look than separate pad, and gives me plenty of room for low-sensitivity gaming.

## Accessories & Misc

- **USB Hub** - Need more ports accessible on the desktop
- **Webcam** - For streaming, something 1080p60 at least
- **Lighting** - Maybe a key light for streaming, and some bias lighting behind the monitor
- **Headphone stand** - Keep things tidy
- **Cable management** - Raceways, velcro ties, under-desk tray

## Budget Breakdown

| Category | Estimated |
|----------|-----------|
| CPU (Ryzen 7 7800X3D) | $450 |
| GPU (RTX 4070 Ti Super) | $800 |
| Motherboard (B650) | $180 |
| RAM (32GB DDR5) | $120 |
| Storage (2TB NVMe) | $150 |
| PSU (850W) | $130 |
| Case (NZXT H7 Flow) | $130 |
| CPU Cooler | $90 |
| **Tower Total** | **$2,050** |
| | |
| Monitor (27" 1440p 144Hz+) | $400-800 |
| Standing Desk | $500-700 |
| Chair | $300-400 |
| Keyboard | $100-150 |
| Mouse | $100-150 |
| Headset | $100-200 |
| Misc accessories | $150 |
| **Peripherals Total** | **$1,650-2,550** |
| | |
| **GRAND TOTAL** | **$3,700-4,600** |

Okay, that's more than I originally thought. Might need to make some compromises. Could drop to RTX 4070 Super to save $200, or go with a regular desk instead of standing.

## Build Order

Planning to buy things over the next few months as sales hit:

1. [ ] **Case first** - Can sit in closet, often on sale
2. [ ] **GPU** - Watch for deals, biggest expense
3. [ ] **CPU + Motherboard + RAM** - Buy together for compatibility
4. [ ] **Storage + PSU** - Commodities, easy to find deals
5. [ ] **Monitor** - Wait for a good sale
6. [ ] **Desk & Chair** - Last, need to measure space
7. [ ] **Peripherals** - Can use existing stuff initially
