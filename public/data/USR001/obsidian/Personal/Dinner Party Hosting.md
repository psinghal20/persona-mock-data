# Dinner Party Hosting

We've been talking about having people over more often instead of always meeting at restaurants. It's more personal, more affordable, and honestly more fun when done right. This is my planning guide for hosting dinner parties that actually impress.

## The Guest List Sweet Spot

After a few attempts, I've learned:
- **4-6 guests** is the sweet spot. Enough for good conversation, small enough that you can actually talk to everyone.
- **8 people max** before it becomes overwhelming in our space and I spend the whole night in the kitchen.
- Mix of couples and singles works better than all couples (fewer separate conversations).
- At least one person who's good at keeping conversation going.

## Menu Planning Philosophy

The biggest mistake I used to make was trying to cook restaurant-level food. That's a recipe for stress. Now my approach is:

1. **One impressive main** that I've practiced before
2. **Simple but quality sides** that can be prepped ahead
3. **A showstopper dessert** (can be store-bought from a good bakery, no shame)
4. **Good bread and butter** because it covers any gaps
5. **Cheese board for arrival** so people have something while I finish cooking

### Make-Ahead is Everything

The goal is to spend time with guests, not be stuck in the kitchen. Look for:
- Appetizers that can sit out (cheese, charcuterie, olives)
- Mains that can be prepped earlier and finished quickly
- Sides that can be roasted while the main rests
- Desserts that are served cold or room temp

## Menu Ideas by Vibe

- *Side:* Big green salad with good olive oil and lemon
- *Bread:* Crusty French baguette or ciabatta rolls
- *Dessert:* Tiramisu (can make day before) or gelato with biscotti

**Shopping:**

**Shopping:**
- Chickpeas for hummus (or buy good premade)

## The Bar Setup

### Wine Pairings
I'm not a sommelier but some basic rules:
- Red with red meat, white with chicken/fish (but honestly drink what you like)
- Have both available and let people choose
- One nice bottle to open with dinner, plus a couple backup bottles
- Sparkling for arrival is always festive

### Non-Alcoholic Options
Always have something nice for non-drinkers:
- Sparkling water with citrus
- Nice ginger beer
- Mocktail ingredients (we usually do a virgin mojito situation)

### After-Dinner Coffee
This is where I want to step it up. Good coffee after dinner is such a nice touch.

**Coffee service ideas:**
- French press with quality beans - maybe a single-origin Ethiopian with floral notes (Yirgacheffe is beautiful)
- Or a smooth medium roast that works for everyone - Colombian or Guatemalan
- For guests who want decaf - Swiss water process decaf so it still tastes good
- Offer espresso if I get around to fixing the machine

**To have on hand:**
- Quality whole beans (buy fresh, grind before brewing)
- Heavy cream (not half and half for coffee service)
- Brown sugar cubes
- Maybe some chocolate for alongside

For special occasions, the Panamanian Geisha coffee is supposed to be incredible, but it's expensive - save for really impressing someone.

## Table Setting & Atmosphere

### The Table
- Actual tablecloth or nice placemats (not the everyday ones)
- Cloth napkins if we have enough
- Candles - unscented so they don't compete with food
- Fresh flowers as centerpiece - nothing too tall that blocks conversation

**Centerpiece flowers:**
- Simple and elegant works best. Not a huge arrangement.
- White lilies or roses keep it classic and don't clash with food
- Or seasonal mixed flowers - something in a low vase
- Greenery and candles together looks nice too

### Lighting
- Dim the overheads, rely on candles and lamps
- Fairy lights on the patio for outdoor dinners
- Nothing fluorescent, nothing harsh

### Music
- Jazz or acoustic background - Spotify has good dinner party playlists
- Volume low enough for conversation
- No lyrics I'll be tempted to sing along to

## The Day-Of Timeline

### Morning
- Shop for any last fresh items (bread, flowers)
- Prep anything that can be done ahead
- Set the table
- Chill wine

### Afternoon
- Clean common areas (hide clutter in bedroom, close that door)
- Prep dessert if making
- Cut cheese board components
- Set out plates and servingware

### 2 Hours Before
- Start any slow-cooking items
- Put together appetizer spreads
- Ice bucket ready
- Take out butter to soften

### 1 Hour Before
- Light candles
- Start playlist
- Pour myself one drink (just one, to relax)
- Final kitchen prep

### 30 Minutes Before

### Guests Arrive
- Offer drinks immediately
- Cheese board is out, no rush
- Don't apologize for anything

## Shopping Lists by Category

### From the Bakery
For dessert and bread - these make a huge difference vs. grocery store.

**Breads:**
- Sourdough loaf - crusty, tangy, perfect with cheese
- French baguettes - for dinner service
- Ciabatta rolls - if doing individual portions
- Focaccia - for Italian themed nights

**Desserts:**
- Chocolate layer cake - crowd pleaser, rich ganache
- New York cheesecake - classic, always a hit
- Carrot cake - for fall dinners
- Assorted French macarons - elegant, colorful, great with coffee
- Croissants and pastries for next-morning brunch if people stay over

### From the Grocery
See [[Grocery List]] for staples, but dinner party specific:

**Proteins:**
- Chicken breast (boneless skinless for easy main)
- Salmon fillets (wild-caught Atlantic)
- Ribeye steaks for grilling
- Bacon for appetizers and salads

**Produce:**
- Salad greens - baby spinach or mixed greens
- Lemons (always need more than you think)
- Fresh herbs - rosemary, thyme, basil, parsley
- Garlic (fresh, not jarred)
- Root vegetables for roasting

**Dairy:**
- Heavy cream (for sauces and coffee)

**Pantry:**

### From the Florist
Centerpiece flowers - order ahead for weekend parties.

- Simple roses in a single color - romantic dinner vibe
- The "modern minimalist" style with calla lilies if going contemporary
- Sunflower and wildflower mix for rustic/casual

Keep it low so people can see across the table!

## Dietary Restrictions Checklist

Always ask guests ahead of time:
- [ ] Any vegetarians/vegans? (Keep some dishes plant-based)
- [ ] Gluten-free needs? (Rice dishes, check bakery for GF options)
- [ ] Nut allergies? (Common and serious, check everything)
- [ ] Dairy-free? (Have non-dairy options for coffee)
- [ ] Other allergies or restrictions?

Plan at least one dish per course that works for everyone.

## Lessons Learned

### What Works
- Starting with drinks and cheese board immediately - takes pressure off
- Having the main mostly done before guests arrive
- Asking one friend to help with dishes (they always offer)
- Sending everyone home with leftovers

### What Doesn't Work
- Attempting a new recipe the night of (practice first!)
- Too many courses - people get full and you're exhausted
- Overthinking the wine pairing
- Cleaning up during the party (just let it go)

## Upcoming Dinner Parties

### March - Birthday Dinner for Sarah (6 people)
- [ ] Book date with her
- [ ] Get guest list
- [ ] Plan menu around her favorites (she loves Italian)
- [ ] Order birthday cake from bakery - chocolate
- [ ] Get flowers for table and maybe a small bouquet for her

### Spring - Housewarming (if we move)
- Bigger party, 10-12 people
- More casual - heavy apps and stations rather than sit-down
- Need to figure out seating/standing situation
- Hire help? Or ask close friends to pitch in
