# Home Office Setup

With the shift to hybrid work, it's time to stop treating my home office as an afterthought. I've been working from a corner of the dining table with my laptop propped on books, and it's not sustainable. My back hurts, my neck hurts, and I look terrible on video calls with that ceiling light behind me.

Time to create a proper workspace.

## Goals for This Space

1. **Comfortable for 8+ hour workdays** - Ergonomics are the priority
2. **Professional video call background** - I'm on Zoom constantly
3. **Good for focused work** - Minimize distractions
4. **Dual purpose** - Sometimes need to do creative work, writing, maybe light photo editing
5. **Clean aesthetic** - Scandinavian minimal, not "gamer cave"

The spare bedroom is about 10x12 feet, so I have decent space to work with but not unlimited.

## The Desk Situation

This is the foundation of everything. I've been researching standing desks because sitting all day is killing me, and being able to switch positions seems like a game-changer.

**What I want:**
- Electric sit-stand with programmable height presets
- At least 60 inches wide for dual monitors and some desk space for notes
- Solid wood or wood-look top (not glass, not pure white laminate)
- Good cable management system built in
- Stable at standing height - no wobbling during typing

I've seen some really nice walnut-top standing desks that would look great with a black metal frame. The electric ones with memory buttons seem worth the premium - being able to hit a button and have it go to exactly my sitting or standing height without adjusting every time.

**Alternative:** If standing desk is too expensive, a quality fixed-height desk at proper ergonomic height (around 29-30 inches) would work. Maybe an L-shaped desk if I want more surface area for spreading out documents or having a separate area for creative work.

## Chair - The Most Important Purchase

I cannot stress this enough: a good chair is more important than any tech purchase. I've learned this the hard way. My current cheap office chair has zero lumbar support and I'm paying for it in chiropractor visits.

**Requirements:**
- Proper lumbar support (adjustable is best)
- Adjustable armrests (height and width)
- Breathable material - mesh back preferred, I run hot
- Adjustable seat depth
- Good warranty (the quality chairs have 10+ year warranties)
- NOT a "gaming chair" - those racing-style chairs look unprofessional and I've heard they're not actually that ergonomic

I'm willing to spend $400-500 here because it's an investment in my health. The ergonomic mesh chairs seem to be the sweet spot - good airflow, supportive, and professional looking.

**Dream chairs:** Herman Miller Aeron, Steelcase Leap - but those are $1,000+ unless I find them used.

## Monitor Setup

Currently using just my laptop screen which is way too small for productivity. I want a proper dual monitor setup, or at least one large monitor plus laptop as secondary.

**Option 1: Single Ultrawide**
A 34" curved ultrawide at 3440x1440 would give me tons of screen real estate without the bezel in the middle. Good for having documents side by side. The curve supposedly helps with eye strain at that width.

**Option 2: Dual 27" Monitors**
Two 27-inch 1440p monitors gives more flexibility - I can angle them how I want, use one for video calls while working on the other. More traditional setup.

**Option 3: One nice monitor + laptop**
Get one high-quality 27" or 32" 4K monitor as the primary, use laptop screen as secondary for email/Slack. Simpler setup, less cable management.

**What matters for work:**
- IPS panel for accurate colors (I do some photo editing)
- 4K or 1440p resolution - 1080p is too low at 27"+ sizes
- USB-C with Power Delivery would be amazing - one cable to laptop for video + charging
- Adjustable stand (height, tilt, swivel) or VESA mount compatible
- Low blue light / flicker-free for eye comfort during long days

I think I'm leaning toward a single 32" 4K monitor with USB-C. Clean setup, great for productivity, and the USB-C connectivity would simplify my cable situation a lot.

## Computer Situation

I have a work-issued laptop (MacBook Pro 14") which handles everything fine, so I don't need a desktop for work. But I'm considering a personal machine for:
- Personal projects and side work
- Creative stuff (photo editing, maybe video)
- Keeping work and personal separate

**Options:**

**Just use the work laptop** - Simplest. Already have it. But mixing personal stuff on work machine isn't ideal.

**Personal laptop** - Something like a MacBook Air or a nice Windows ultrabook. Portable, can use at the desk or on the couch. The M3 MacBook Airs are incredibly capable for the price.

**Mac Mini or similar compact desktop** - More power for the money than a laptop since no battery/screen. Could hide it behind the monitor for a clean desk. The Mac Mini with M2 is great value.

**Full desktop PC** - Overkill for my needs, but would be powerful for video editing. See [[PC Gaming Setup]] if I go this route.

Honestly, a MacBook Air 15" would probably be perfect. Great screen when I'm mobile, plenty of power for photo editing, and I can just plug into my monitor setup when at the desk.

## Webcam & Video Call Setup

This is surprisingly important. I'm on video calls 3-4 hours a day and looking professional matters.

**Webcam:**
The built-in MacBook camera is fine but mounted below eye level which isn't flattering. Want an external webcam I can position at eye level on top of my monitor.
- 1080p minimum, 4K nice to have
- Good low-light performance
- Auto-focus that actually works
- Wide enough angle to show some background but not my whole room

**Lighting:**
This is the secret to looking good on camera. Natural light is best but not always available. Options:
- **Key light** - A dedicated light for video calls, usually LED panel on an arm
- **Ring light** - Popular but can look harsh and give weird eye reflections
- **Bias lighting** - LED strip behind the monitor, reduces eye strain AND looks good in background
- **Desk lamp** - Something warm and indirect for ambient light

I think a small LED panel key light plus some bias lighting behind the monitor would be the move. Position the key light to the side for more natural-looking illumination.

**Microphone:**
The webcam mic is usually terrible. Options:
- **USB condenser mic** - Best quality, but takes desk space and might pick up keyboard noise
- **Lavalier mic** - Clips to shirt, good for calls, less visible
- **Headset with good mic** - Practical, consistent quality, looks a bit "call center"

For professional calls, a decent USB mic on a small arm is probably the best balance. Can push it aside when not in calls.

**Background:**
Need to think about what's behind me on camera. Currently it's a blank wall which is boring. Ideas:
- Small bookshelf with some books and plants
- A few framed prints
- Keep it minimal and professional, not cluttered

## Storage & Organization

**Bookshelf:**
Need somewhere for books, binders, and some display items. A ladder bookshelf could look nice and doesn't take up much floor space. Or floating shelves on the wall behind me (good for video call background).

**Filing:**
I still have some paper documents I need to keep. A small filing cabinet that fits under the desk would work. Two or three drawers max.

**Desk organization:**
- Pen holder / desk organizer
- Cable management tray under desk
- Monitor arm to free up desk space
- Wireless charging pad for phone

## Accessories & Small Stuff

**Keyboard:**
Since I'll be typing all day, want something comfortable:
- Wireless to reduce cable clutter
- Full-size or TKL layout (need the number pad for spreadsheets? TBD)
- Quiet switches - don't want to annoy people on calls
- Nice typing feel - maybe a good membrane or quiet mechanical

**Mouse:**
- Ergonomic shape for long use
- Wireless
- Quiet clicks
- Maybe a vertical mouse? Heard they're better for wrist strain

**Other:**
- Laptop stand to raise it to eye level when using as secondary screen
- USB-C hub/dock for connecting everything with one cable
- Headphones - good for focus time and calls
- Blue light glasses - skeptical but might try
- Plants - something low maintenance to make the space feel alive
- Small clock or timer for pomodoro sessions

## The Aesthetic

Going for Scandinavian minimal meets warm professional. Color palette:
- Walnut/oak wood tones
- Black metal accents
- White walls
- Maybe a sage green or navy accent
- Warm lighting, not cool/harsh

No RGB, no gamer aesthetics, no cluttered "productivity YouTube" overload. Just a clean, calm space that's pleasant to work in.

## Budget Planning

| Category | Budget | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Standing Desk | $500-700 | Worth investing here |
| Chair | $400-500 | Most important purchase |
| Monitor (32" 4K) | $400-600 | USB-C if possible |
| Webcam | $100-150 | 1080p with good low-light |
| Lighting (key + bias) | $100-150 | |
| Microphone | $80-130 | USB with arm |
| Keyboard | $80-120 | Wireless, quiet |
| Mouse | $50-80 | Ergonomic wireless |
| Bookshelf | $150-250 | |
| Accessories | $200 | Cables, organizers, plants |
| **Total** | **$2,060-2,880** | |

If adding a personal laptop (MacBook Air), add another $1,100-1,300.

## Priority Order

If I can't do everything at once:

1. [ ] **Chair** - Health first, I need this now
2. [ ] **Desk** - Foundation of the setup
3. [ ] **Monitor** - Huge productivity boost
4. [ ] **Webcam + Lighting** - Professional presence
5. [ ] **Keyboard + Mouse** - Comfort upgrades
6. [ ] **Storage** - Organization
7. [ ] **Accessories** - Nice to haves
8. [ ] **Personal laptop** - If/when needed

## Inspiration & Ideas

- Keep desk surface mostly clear, store things in drawers
- Route all cables through desk cable tray and down one leg
- One plant on desk (pothos? snake plant?), one larger floor plant
- Maybe a small whiteboard on the wall for brainstorming
- Keep phone in a drawer during focus time
