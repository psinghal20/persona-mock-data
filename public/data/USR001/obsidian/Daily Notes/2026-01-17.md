# Daily Note - January 17, 2026

## Tasks
- [x] Configure agent environment
- [x] Add new MCP servers to template
- [x] Test git submodules setup
- [ ] Update documentation

## Notes
### Agent Environment Setup
Successfully configured the Docker environment for running MCP servers. Added several new servers including:
- Shopping MCP server
- Terminal shop integration
- Coles/Woolworths API

### Technical Challenges
Ran into an issue with git submodules not being properly initialized. Fixed by updating the submodule configuration and running:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Research
Looked into Obsidian plugins for better task management:
- Tasks plugin
- Dataview for queries
- Calendar integration

## Reading
Started reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" - Chapter 5 on Replication

## Tomorrow
- Set up Obsidian MCP server
- Create mock data for testing
