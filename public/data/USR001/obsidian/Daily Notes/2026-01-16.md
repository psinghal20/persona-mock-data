# Daily Note - January 16, 2026

## Tasks
- [x] Research MCP server options
- [x] Evaluate Obsidian integration possibilities
- [x] Team standup
- [x] Code review

## Notes
### MCP Server Research
Explored various MCP servers available for integration:

| Server | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Obsidian | Knowledge management | Planned |
| Airbnb | Travel search | Added |
| FlightRadar24 | Flight tracking | Added |

### Architecture Discussion
Had a productive discussion about the overall architecture. Key points:
- Keep server configurations modular
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Cache static responses where possible

## Ideas
- Create a unified dashboard for monitoring all MCP servers
- Implement health checks for each server
- Add rate limiting

## Exercise
- 30 min walk
- Stretching routine
